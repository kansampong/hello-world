# hello-world

Nana here. I don't know a thing about programming but I'm very eager to learn and excel at it.
It's currently 02:41 GMT on April 21 in the year of Corona 2020(Really, it owns this year. I mean Kobe's demise seems like eons ago). 
Typing this from my room in Accra because if I can't sleep I might as well be productive, right? 
I'm trying to figure out this coding thing. This seems like a challenge but so is waking up everyday in these uncertain times.
Read a bit online about Python and AWS.
Also read about Data Science/Engineering.
